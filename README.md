# Bookmarkify-React

A google Chrome extension to bookmark anywhere on a web page and save it for later to quickly scroll to that bookmark.

Reading a very long article or tutorial and finishing it in one go sometimes is difficult. You might want to save your progress so that when you revisit the same page again you might want to quickly jump to the section where you had left last time instead of keep scrolling.

This extension will help user to select any text on a web page and save it as a bookmark, so that when user is revisiting the same web page, user will be able to see all the saved bookmark on right side of the page in a transparent bar, which will appear only on hover. User will have ability to delete the existing bookmarks. For every unique URL there will be unique list of bookmarks.
